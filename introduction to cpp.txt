1. Introduction to C++
C++ is a high-level programming language that extends the features of the C language. 
Developed by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1983, C++ is known for its object-oriented programming features, which enable code reusability, modularity, and maintainability.
 It is widely used for developing system software, games, embedded systems, and high-performance applications.

2. Definition of C++
C++ is a general-purpose programming language that combines procedural and object-oriented programming paradigms.
 It provides low-level memory manipulation features and supports multiple programming methodologies, making it a versatile and powerful tool for various applications.

3. Built-in Functions in C++
Built-in functions in C++ are pre-defined operations that help in performing common tasks.
 Some of the most commonly used built-in functions include:

Mathematical Functions (sqrt(), pow(), abs(), etc.)

String Manipulation Functions (strlen(), strcat(), strcmp(), etc.)

Input/Output Functions (cin, cout, getline() etc.)

Utility Functions (swap(), min(), max())

These functions are included in the C++ Standard Library and must be accessed by including the appropriate header files.

4. Header Files in C++
Header files are files that include pre-defined classes, objects, and functions. Some common header files in C++ include:

<iostream>: Input and output operations (e.g., cin, cout).

<cmath>: Mathematical functions (e.g., sqrt, pow).

<string>: String handling functions.

<vector>: Functions for working with the vector data type.

<algorithm>: Functions for searching, sorting, etc.

5. Datatypes in C++
Datatypes in C++ specify the type of data that can be stored in a variable. Examples include:

Primitive Datatypes:

int (Integer)

float (Floating-point numbers)

double (Double precision floating-point numbers)

char (Character)

bool (Boolean: true or false)

Derived Datatypes:

Arrays

Pointers

References

User-defined Datatypes:

Structures (struct)

Classes

Enumerations (enum)

6. Keywords in C++
Keywords are reserved words in C++ that have special meanings and cannot be used as identifiers (variable names).
 Here are some examples:

Access Modifiers: public, private, protected

Control Statements: if, else, while, for, switch, case

Data Type Modifiers: signed, unsigned, long, short

Object-Oriented Keywords: class, this, new, delete, virtual

Miscellaneous Keywords: return, namespace, constexpr.
